# Fire_identification.ipynb

This file is the baseline CNN model. Details explained on the nodebook

# fire_model_with_autoencoder_layers.ipynb

The CNN model using lower level layers from trained CNN autoencoder

# VAN_trained_vae.ipynb

The variational autoencoder trained by fire only data.

# fire_identification_autoencoder.ipynb

Two CNN autoencoders trained as trained weights and layers provider.

# general_GAN_fire.ipynb

A GAN using trained CNN autoencoder as the generator with additional layers and discriminator

# Fire_GANs.ipynb

Two GANs: one made by CNN autoender, another made by VAE 

### Data source

A fire equipment company, the images are on my drive, please require access if you need to, by emailing me.

Image samples were showed on notebooks.

### Ensemble method 

This is not included on the notebooks because it needs load all classification and discriminator models, 
which are on my drive and the size is too huge to submit. 


### Details of this project could be found on my notebooks
