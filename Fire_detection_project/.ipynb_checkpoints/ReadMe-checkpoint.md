### Data source

A fire equipment company, the images are on my drive, please require access data if you need to run those scripts, 
by emailing me at frankwc6@bu.edu.

Image samples were showed on notebooks.

### Ensemble method 

This is not included on the notebooks because it needs load all classifiers from my drive, 
You can save all models and make a simple output script to do inferences. 


### Details of this project could be found on my notebooks
